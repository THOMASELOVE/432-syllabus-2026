# Teaching Assistants {#sec-teachingassistants}

This year's stellar group of teaching assistants have been in your shoes - they've taken the course in the past, and they enjoyed it enough to come back for more. They are volunteering their precious time and energy to help make the course happen, and we couldn't be more delighted to welcome you to the course. All office hours and all teaching assistant work will be done remotely.

There is a lot to learn in this class. Don't suffer in silence - talk to us! As mentioned earlier, **you shouldn't spend more than 15 minutes struggling with anything in this class without asking for help.**

Visit the [Getting Help with 432](05-gettinghelp.qmd) section of this Syllabus for more details.

## TA office hours

TA office hours are held via Zoom, will begin in mid-January and continue through the end of the semester, excluding Spring Break and Martin Luther King Day.
